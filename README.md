# keylogger.cpp
 > just a simple c++ keylogger for Windows

## Installation
Clone the repo or simply download the executable "keylogger.exe", and you're ready to go!

## Usage 
First of all, make sure you have a "log.txt" file in the same directory as your executable or change the directory in the code (that requires compiling again). That's where all the keys are going to be stored. <br />
Then, just run the executable and that's it! Every word typed after the excution of the program will be stored in a line at "log.txt" <br />
Whenever you want to close the program, just press "ESC". <br />
> Note: if you run the program through the terminal (by typing "keylogger.exe") you'll get live feedback of what's happening, every character and every keycode will be printed out to the console. You can disable this by removing the lines with "cout << ..." from the code (this requires compiling again).

## Disclaimer
Beware!! **Using a keylogger may be illegal depending on how you use it.** <br />
