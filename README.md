# C++ Keylogger 
 > just a simple c++ keylogger for Windows

## Installation
Clone the repo or simply download the executable "main.exe", and you're ready to go!

## Usage 
First of all, make sure you have a "log.txt" file in the same directory as your executable. That's where all the keys are going to be stored.
Then, just run the executable and that's it! 
Whenever you want to close the program, just press "ESC".

## Disclaimer
Beware!! **Using a keylogger may be illegal depending on how you use it.**
