# C++ Keylogger 
 > just a simple c++ keylogger for Windows

## Installation
Clone the repo or simply download the executable "main.exe", and you're ready to go!

## Usage 
First of all, make sure you have a "log.txt" file in the same directory as your executable. That's where all the keys are going to be stored. <br />
Then, just run the executable and that's it! <br />
Whenever you want to close the program, just press "ESC".

## Disclaimer
Beware!! **Using a keylogger may be illegal depending on how you use it.** <br />
